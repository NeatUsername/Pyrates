When the owners could not get in touch with the tanker, the owners contacted the IMB Piracy Reporting Centre which immediately relayed the message to all authorities in the vicinity and broadcast the message to all ships in the ocean region. The IMB PRC then continuously liaised with the owners and the Vietnam authorities on the location of the tanker. The Vietnam Marine Police intercepted the tanker and detained all the pirates and escorted the tanker to a port for further investigations.

      "Armed robbers boarded an anchored chemical tanker and took the duty officer hostage to the Masters cabin. When the Master opened the cabin door the robbers hit the Master on the face and ordered to muster the crew on the bridge.  Once the crew were mustered on the bridge one of the younger robbers was very violent and beat the crew as well as broke a glass on one of the crews head.  The robbers asked the Master and the C/O about the cargo in the tanks and when the Master replied that the vessel was in ballast the robbers again beat the Master and asked him to weigh anchor and proceed south. At around 0315 LT, the robbers speed boat returned with more people. At around 0500 LT, the tanker sailed towards Lagos and the robbers appeared to be negotiating on the satellite phone. They then ordered the Master to use the tanker to approach other vessels in the area and they asked the crew to fabricate a ladder in facilitate the boarding. On 16 Jun, the robbers took two crew members and  disembarked from the tanker with the rescue boat taking along ship’s cash, crew cash and personal belongings. The crew were released once later. Three crew members injured during the incident. Incident reported to Togo and French Authorities.\n",

      "While enroute from Singapore to Haiphong, an asphalt tanker was boarded by five pirates armed with guns and knives. The Master and C/O were taken hostage and taken to the bridge. The remaining crew were forced to muster in the crew mess room and were threatened at gun point. Master was forced to switched off the Bridge Navigational Watch Alarm System (BNWAS) and was ordered to slow down the tanker. The pirates then took the Master to his cabin and stole ship’s cash and locked him in the mess room with other crew. The pirates ransacked the crew cabins and escaped with crew cash and personal belongings. The Master and crew later emerged from the mess room and activated the SSAS, informed their head office and made an announcement on VHF channel 16 to alert other ships in the vicinity.

      "While transiting the Sibutu passage, two high speed crafts were sighted approaching an ore carrier underway. As the boats closed to the ship, the crew could see a blue colored boat with two persons wearing face masks and a white colored boat with one person wearing a face mask. Two Philippine Naval patrol vessels contacted the ore carrier via vhf channel 16. The high-speed boats closed to three cables from the ship, noticed the hardening, crossed the shipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stern and moved away. The ship had received cautionary advice from the Philippine Navy and Coast Guard Coast Watch as they were transiting the Sibutu passage.\n",

They damaged the navigation and all communication equipment, stole crew and ship's property, locked all the crew in one cabin and took the Master as hostage. On 09 Apr 2019, a Spanish Navy Warship tried to establish communication with the tanker. On receiving no response, the warship approached the tanker, resulting in the pirates escaping. The Master told the naval boarding team that they had been held hostage for four days.  After investigations, the naval boarding team disembarked. While continuing on her voyage, the main engines had to be shut down due to overheating. The C/E noticed ingress of water into the engine room, which was later fixed. Without any communication equipment that is still working, the tanker was adrift for 12 days before being able to hail a fishing boat for assistance.
